            <p>
              I spent the most time exploring the different projects by clicking
              into each one to see the details. I scrolled through the images
              and description of the project and realized that all projects have
              their own background colors which makes the experience feel
              unique. The project also contains many pictures so that people can
              immediately understand the appearance of the work without having
              to read the text carefully.

              The most common action during this interaction was continuously
              scrolling through the website’s content while I frequently clicked
              or hovered over different typography elements and symbols to see
              if it can trigger more animations, transitions, and information.
              Because the site has rich visualization, which bring out my
              curiosity that want to test which elements were functional.

              I think the intended primary goal of this experience is to present
              designer’s portfolio in a creative and impactful way that can
              capture people’s attention immediately. This website not only just
              presents the designer’s works, but also reveals the skills and
              ideas of the designer himself through the interface design.

          <div class="text">
            <p>
              The site utilizes large bold typography and special layout and
              animation titles with various color backgrounds and immersive
              visuals on the interface to attract people’s attention, also
              includes minimal but impactful project descriptions and
              information on each page so users can easily understand the ideas.
              The horizontal and vertical scrolling method that changes
              constantly is also one of the features. These reveal the
              designer’s visual creativity and professional branding.

              This website feels like is for short but repeated experience.

              explore few projects and then revisit for others later, which

              The website references the magazine layout through large and bold

              The motion-driven visualization and studio photos make the website
              feels like a professional digital photography gallery.

            <p>
              The website doesn’t have a menu to let the users jump directly to
              the contents they want, requiring them to scroll through
              everything. In addition, there is no clear home navigation icon,
              so I initially had to scroll all the way back up or refresh the
              page to return. It was only later that I discovered the “R”
              typography in the top-left corner functions as a home button.

            <p>
              The most satisfying part for me is the immersive animated
              background combined with the dynamic titles that change as I
              scroll. It creates a sense of movement that makes me feel
              engaging. I also enjoy the unique scrolling behavior, although I
              scroll down with my mouse, the interface actually moves
              horizontally, this transition let the website feel modern and high
              quality, also can presents the designer’s creativity. These
              special browsing experience not just grab people’s attention, also
              like exploring a interactive gallery.
